1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
Let's try Mateo ice cream first.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's make people try our gelatos.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,360
There is a challenge. You have two ice creams. Mine is dark chocolate,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,520
chili peppers and honey. Mine is with lemon, olive oil

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,680
and black pepper. I know. Be open minded.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,240
And then both. I'm really ready. Let's try Mateo ice cream first.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,020
Flavor. I like it. He likes it. He doesn't love it. It's a unique

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,700
flavor. It's interesting in a positive way.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,260
Said excellent. Eight out of ten. Very, very spicy.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,620
The best two, one. I'm voting for Emiliano just

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,060
to be sure he knows. He knows we love spice.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,140
Okay. I'm a chocolate lover. I had to go. Mateo.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,140
Let's see.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,240
Congratulations. Sorry, Matt. Let me try

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,040
yours. I want to try yours too. I mean, it's pretty good. It is actually

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,760
good. And the votes are even. Let's do this. They decide which one

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,200
wins. Write it in a.
