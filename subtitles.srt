00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,920
Let's try Mateo ice cream first. Let's make

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,440
people try our gelatos.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,360
There is a challenge. You have two ice creams. Mine is dark chocolate,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,640
chili peppers and honey. Mine is with lemon,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,600
olive oil and black pepper. I know.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,680
Be open minded. And then both. I'm really ready. Let's try Mateo ice

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,240
cream first.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,340
Flavor. I like it. He likes it. He doesn't love it.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,700
It's a unique flavor. It's interesting in a positive way.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,260
Said excellent. Eight out of ten. Very, very spicy.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,860
The best two, one. I'm voting for Emiliano just to be

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,500
sure he knows. He knows we love spice. Okay.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm a chocolate lover. I had to go. Mateo.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,140
Let's see.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,600
Congratulations. Sorry, Matt. Let me try yours.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,360
I want to try yours too. I mean, it's pretty good. It is actually good.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,240
And the votes are even. Let's do this. They decide which one wins.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,200
Write it in a.
